# PRODIGY_DS_4
To analyze traffic accident data and identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day, as well as visualize accident hot spots and contributing factors, we can follow these steps:
data set i used is customized : https://drive.google.com/file/d/15KQ-eskxCCKoYqlVO1BuYfuds2cscCsk/view?usp=drive_link


STEP 1 : Data Preprocessing:

           Load the dataset.
           Handle missing values, if any.
           Convert relevant columns to appropriate data types.
           Explore the dataset to understand its structure and content
           
STEP 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

           Examine the distribution of accidents over different times of the day, days of the week, and months of the year.
           Investigate the relationship between accidents and weather conditions (e.g., rain, snow, fog).
           Analyze the impact of road conditions (e.g., wet, dry, icy) on accident occurrence.
           Explore the distribution of accidents across different regions or cities.
           
STEP 3 : Visualization:

           Create visualizations to illustrate the findings from the EDA process.
           Heatmaps highlighting accident hot spots based on geographic coordinates.
           Pie charts or bar plots showing the proportion of accidents attributed to various contributing factors.
       
  Spatial Analysis:

          Utilize geospatial visualization techniques to map accident locations and identify hot spots.
          Consider clustering algorithms to identify areas with a high density of accidents.
# Statistical Analysis:
         Conduct statistical tests (e.g., chi-square test) to determine if there are significant associations between accident occurrence and factors such as weather conditions or time 
         of day 
# Predictive Modeling :
         Build predictive models to forecast the likelihood of accidents based on various factors.
